import { withRouter } from 'next/router'

/*
Since Next 5 we provide a way to explicitly inject the Next.js router object into pages and all their decending components.
The router property that is injected will hold the same values as url, like pathname, asPath, and query.
Here's an example of using withRouter:
*/
class Post extends React.Component {
  ///*
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    // `super` must be used before using `this`.
    this.id =  '123a' // constructor properties is not possible to change later for all descendants.
    console.log(props)
    //const r = this.props.router // create failure in constructor.
    //console.log(r)
  }
  //*/
  static async getInitialProps({query}) {
    console.log('SLUG',query.slug)
    return {}
  }
  render() {
    //const router = this.props.router
    const {router} = this.props
    console.log(router)
    this.qw = router.query.slug
    return <h1>This is post.js page with ?slug=something as {this.qw} and id is {this.id}</h1> // {this.qw}
  }
}

//export default Post
export default withRouter(Post)
